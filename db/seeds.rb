# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# stevie wonder = Artist.new(name: "Stevie Wonder", bio: "Best musician of all time")
# michael jackson = Artist.new(name: "Michael Jackson", bio: "Best singer and dancer")
# moodymann = Artist.new(name: "Moodymann", bio: "Dj from Detroit")
#
# soul = Genre.new(name:"Soul")
# pop = Genre.new(name:"Pop")
# funk = Genre.new(name:"Funk")
